# NYC Bikesharing Data

## Overview
After a fantastic trip to NYC, we decided that a bike-sharing venture would be a wonderful idea for Des Moines. To show how bike-sharing could be a benefit to Des Moines, we took data that is already available for the NYC program and used that to determine how the bikes are utilized in the big city. After reviewing the results we have a great idea of how the bike-sharing business could work in Des Moines, even though it is significantly different than New York.

## Results
Using Tableau Public we were able to create an interactive story that explains how New York's bike-sharing system works. That story can be found here:

The first page shows a breakdown of customers by type, showing that over 3/4 of bike riders are subscribers, and that there were over 2 million rides taken in August 2019. In addition, looking at how long the bikes were checked-out for, it shows that a majority of the bike rides lasted fewer than 20 minutes.

The next page shows that in general ride length goes up as age goes down, with a noticable spike in ride duration for 50 year old clients.

The next page is a breakdown of bike-rides by stop-time, looking at the days of the week and the times of day that the bike rides are most likely to end. It shows heaviest utilization is around 8AM and 6PM during the weekdays, coinciding with commute times. The weekends have their heaviest utilization spread out more across the middle part of the day, which would make sense for tourists who are utilizing the service on the weekends.

Next some of the same data is broken down by genders, amount of time the bikes are checked out along with user trips by gender by weekday, also broken down by customer type. Both of these breakdowns show that men are the highest utilizers of the service. It also shows that male subscribers are the most likely to use the service every day of the week.

![Story4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85318060/135730126-4dd6f66e-304d-4c82-b453-6afa92d9d3d2.png)

Finally, the last breakdown shows that even when you account for gender, commute times are the highest utilization times for the bikes, with the very highest utilization coming on weekdays by men during usual commute times. There is an interesting break in the pattern on Wednesday evening that would be worth doing more research into to see what is causing the lower utilization then, but we did not go into that for the purposes of this evaluation.

## Summary
In summary, it appears the highest utilization of the bike-sharing system are men during their usual commute times. Women use the bikes to a lesser extent, though the pattern of high utilization during commute times still holds. It also appears that the highest utilization of the bike system comes from subscribers to the program as opposed to regular people. If I had more time to do further analysis I would want to break down start or stop time by user type to see if the people subscribing to the bikes are the ones that are using them for a daily commute. I would also like to do a breakdown of starting and stopping location by user types to see if there is a concentration of non-subscribing users centered around more tourist attractions.
